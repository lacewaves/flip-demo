# flip-demo

This was created as a demonstration of CSS-based flip animations for the Back End Engineering course at Iron Yard during my time working as a Teaching Assistant for our Ruby on Rails courses. I noticed that students often struggle with understanding how div layers function, and how to use CSS transitions. Enjoy this code snippet if you need to make a card flip between two images.
