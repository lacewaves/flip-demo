# CSS Flip Cards Demo
#### Demonstration for students at The Iron Yard
This was created as a live demonstration of CSS-based flip animations for the Back End Engineering course at Iron Yard during my time working as a Teaching Assistant for our Ruby on Rails courses. I noticed that students often struggle with understanding how div layers function and how to use CSS transitions. 

Enjoy this code snippet if you need to make a card flip between two images.
